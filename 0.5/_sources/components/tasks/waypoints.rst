=========
Waypoints
=========

Travel to a sequence of points (or poses). Use :doc:`path` instead when points are dense and you want to just pass by.

Example
=======

.. video:: waypoints.mp4
  :loop:
  :width: 780

The video has been recorded using

.. code-block:: console

   $ navground_py record_video waypoints.yaml waypoints.mp4 --factor 5

with the following configuration

.. literalinclude :: waypoints.yaml
   :language: YAML
