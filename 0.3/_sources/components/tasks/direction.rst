Direction 
=========

Possibly the simplest non trivial task: move towards a direction.

Example
=======

.. video:: direction.mp4
  :loop:
  :width: 780

The video has been recorded using

.. code-block:: console

   $ navground_py record_video direction.yaml direction.mp4 --factor 5

with the following configuration

.. literalinclude :: direction.yaml
   :language: YAML
