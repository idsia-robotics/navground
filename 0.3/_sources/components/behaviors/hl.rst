Our navigation behavior that mimic the model for pedestrains described in 

   Moussa√Ød, Mehdi, Dirk Helbing, and Guy Theraulaz. "How simple rules determine pedestrian behavior and crowd disasters." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 108, no. 17 (2011): 6884-6888.

Human-like performs a search for the direction in which the agents would come nearest to the target before possible collisions. Then is applies an heuristic to select a safe speed in that direction. By construction, Human-like never retract because for it staying in place is always preferable (i.e., nearest to the target) than move away.

Example
=======

.. video:: hl.mp4
  :loop:
  :width: 780

The video has been recorded using

.. code-block:: console

   $ navground_py record_video hl.yaml hl.mp4 --factor 5

with the following configuration

.. literalinclude :: hl.yaml
   :language: YAML
